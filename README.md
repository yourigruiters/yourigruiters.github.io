# Portfolio Project

## How it works

This portfolio is built with React and uses **fake JSON data** that corresponds directly to the actual portfolio content. The left panel displays a JSON-like structure that mirrors the real portfolio data, creating an interactive developer experience.

### Key Features:

- **Fake JSON Editor**: The left panel shows a collapsible JSON structure representing all portfolio data
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes in the JSON editor affect the actual portfolio display
- **Variant System**: Switch between "Combined", "Developer", and "Teacher" views
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for mobile-first design
- **Interactive Elements**: Collapsible work experience, education, and project sections

### Technical Stack:

- React with hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Custom components for JSON-like display
- Local storage for settings persistence

The JSON data is completely simulated - it's just a creative way to showcase the portfolio data in a developer-friendly format!
